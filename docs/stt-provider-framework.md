# Talk Dat! STT Provider Framework

Talk Dat! now separates speech-to-text selection into a provider registry and runtime session adapters.

## Runtime Lanes

- `streaming`: microphone audio is sent while the user is actively holding or using hands-free mode. Deepgram uses this path today.
- `batch`: microphone audio is recorded locally first, then sent after the user releases or stops the session. This keeps hover/idle credit-safe and supports leaderboard models that do not expose a realtime API.
- `local`: microphone audio is recorded locally and transcribed on-device by onnx-asr or faster-whisper. No key, no network after the one-time model download.
- `external`: the model is visible in Settings for planning and public customization, but needs a dedicated adapter, signed cloud auth flow, SDK, or local runner before it can execute.

## Routing

Session routing is driven entirely by the registry's `api_kind` field, so adding a provider that reuses an existing protocol needs only a registry entry:

- `deepgram_stream` routes to the Deepgram live WebSocket session.
- `openai_batch` routes to the OpenAI-compatible `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions` adapter (OpenAI, Groq, xAI, Mistral, custom endpoints).
- `elevenlabs_batch`, `assemblyai_batch`, and `gemini_batch` route to their dedicated batch adapters.
- `local_batch` routes to the on-device engines in `knight_flow/local_stt.py` (onnx-asr for Parakeet/Canary/GigaAM, faster-whisper for the Whisper families). The selected model auto-downloads on first use and the pill reports download/load progress states.
- `external` raises a clear "adapter pending" error instead of failing mid-session.

Providers with `key_optional` set (custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints and local runners) skip the API key requirement. Batch HTTP requests retry transient failures (HTTP 408/429/5xx and network errors) with short exponential backoff before surfacing an error.

## Wired Adapters

- Deepgram live streaming: `deepgram_stream`
- OpenAI-compatible batch transcription: OpenAI, Groq, xAI, Mistral, and custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- ElevenLabs batch transcription
- AssemblyAI upload/transcript/poll batch transcription
- Google Gemini audio batch transcription

## Public Repo Safety

Provider keys are stored only in user config or environment variables. The registry contains public metadata only: provider names, model IDs, capability flags, and docs URLs.
